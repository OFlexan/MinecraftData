# Minecraft data
Contains a collection of usernames from Minecraft players (Java + Bedrock). In the future, this repo will contain conversation data as well.

# Two versions
Every username file contains two versions.  
**Raw**: Includes Bedrock usernames that start with either `.` (new) or `*` (old)  
**Fixed**: Includes Bedrock usernames that start with `.`, even if the last recorded name started with `*`  

In any case, the fixed version is recommended.
